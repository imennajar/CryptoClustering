# CryptoClustering

The cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which is an alternative form of payment created using encryption algorithms.In this challenge, we will use learnhow to use the unsupervised machine learning to make prediction about cryptocurrency.

## What we will learn from this project:

- How to find the Best Value for k

- How to create clusters  with K-means

- How to optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

## Instructions: 

### Prepare the Data:

- Use the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.

- Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.
  
### Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame

- Use the elbow method to find the best value for k.

- Plot a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different values of k to visually identify the optimal value for k.

- Identify the best value for k.
